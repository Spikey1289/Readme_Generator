# Readme_Generator

## Introduction
This is the README for the README generator challenge of my coding bootcamp. This Repository contains a JS file for an application that generates a dynamic README based on user input. The initial files were provided to my by my coding bootcamp.

## Things Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn how to use javascript and node JS to use inquirer to gather information from a user, as well as to generate a markdown file with that user input passed to it. I also learned about README standards and how to make an instructional guide for an application that might be a little less user friendly because it doesn't have a modern UI.

### Application Walkthrough

- After downloading the application files, you're going to need to install node js and inquirer
    - to install node, follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and follow the directions
    - to install inquirer after you have node installed, type 'nvm i' in your integrated terminal
- After both of those steps are completed, you may start the application by navigating to the Readme Generator folder in your terminal, and tying in 'node index.js'
- there will be a series of prompts, answer them (I suggest first writing them out in another text editor and copy-pasting them in to avoid mistakes).
- after all prompts are filled in, a README file will be generated named 'README_OUTPUT.MD'. this file will contain a skeleton of a readme that you can edit further to suit your needs
